Hello everyone, now I show you is based on CM2290 Pose Estimattion AI Demo. 

Pose estimation is the task of using an ML model to estimate the pose of a person from an image or a video by estimating the spatial locations of key body joints

Pose estimation refers to computer vision techniques that detect human figures in images and videos, so that one could determine, for example, where someoneâ€™s elbow shows up in an image. It is important to be aware of the fact that pose estimation merely estimates where key body joints are and does not recognize who is in an image or video.

The pose estimation models takes a processed camera image as the input and outputs information about keypoints. The keypoints detected are indexed by a part ID, with a confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0. The confidence score indicates the probability that a keypoint exists in that position.
Below is the output of a  model Pose Estimattion  on Android. All right, that's the end of the demo
